//////////////////////////////////////
1-What sequencing platform was used to do the sequencing run?
ILLUMINA
2-What is the instrument model used?
Illumina HiSeq 2000
3-What is the library type used for the sequencing? Paired-end? Single-end or mate-pair?
Paired-end
4-What is the type of molecules that have been sequenced?
DNA
5-A the bottom of the page, you can see two fastq file names.
6-What is the extension of these files? What does it indicate?
fastq.gz Its indicates its compressed DNA file.
7-Are these files expected to be different in their contents? Justify your answer.
File 1 will reads in Forward and File 2  reads in reverse ends so the actual nucleotide strings are different. 
8-Select both of the files and click on Get Download script.
9-What are the sizes of both files?
22.905 KB

C. Analyzing the files
////////////////////////////////
1-How many reads do we have in each of the two files? Verify with a Python script that they are correctly paired.
SRR800768_1_sub.fastq has 100000 reads.
SRR800768_2_sub.fastq has 100000 reads.

2-What is the read length?
Read length is: 101 bp

3-Plot the reads per base content for each of the fastq files: 
the x axis is the position on the read (0 to read length - 1) and on the y axis the percentages of each base (A in red, T in green, C in blue and G in black).

4-What do you notice regarding the relative quantity of the different bases? Is it an expected result? Justify your answer.
A and T line basically the same we can also G and C track each other too. A and T bases are significantly more than G and C.
This is expected Chargaf's Rule, which is that in double-stranded DNA, the amount of Adenine equals Thymine and Guanine equals Cytosine. 
Since the sequencing library is double-stranded, we expect these percentages to be mirrored.

5-Estimate the GC content of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae sequenced genome and compare it with the known GC content of the species.
Estimated GC Content: 37.20%

6-For each file, generate a plot illustrating the median, first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3) of the Phred scores for each position in the read. 
The x-axis represents the position on the read, and the y-axis depicts the median (in purple), Q1 (in blue), and Q3 (in red) of the Phred scores.

7-Is the quality of the bases homogeneous across the read? Propose a hypothesis explaining that.
As we can see from the graph the quality is not homegeneous across the read.
Hypothesis: This pattern is a charactheristic of Illumina sequencing chemistry often called signal decay or drop.
This can happen because when the machine performs the cycle after cyle, some DNA molecules
become out of sync and some molecules lag behind. As the reads gets longer this out of sync molecules become larger.
As a result the machine becomes less confident in its base calls towards the end of the read, resulting in lower Phred quality scores at the 3' end.

8-Suggest an algorithm for cleaning reads and implement it in Python. 
This algorithm should allow trimming low-quality bases at the ends of the reads and then keep reads whose length is above a threshold.
As pairing may be disturbed by cleaning, 4 output files are expected:

9-To check the validity of the cleaning algorithm, plot the qualities of the clean paired files as done in part C.6.
